# FRC Claude Design Standards
**Version 2.4 - 2026-08-25**

Scoping and prompting rules for every FRC Team 5669 artifact authored in Claude Design against the FRC design system. Presentations are the primary case.

This is the FRC counterpart to `IDEA_CLAUDE_DESIGN_STANDARDS.md`. Brand, tokens, type, motion, and the component manifest are owned by `FRC_Design_System.md`. This document owns what a prompt must contain. Chat scopes and specifies. Design lays out.

**The system lives in a repo, not in Claude Design.** It is authored as React in `frc-app` at `src/lib/design-system/` and Claude Design sources it from GitHub. This is the single most consequential structural difference from the IDEA system, which was authored inside Claude Design from a written description of Svelte components and has drifted from `idea-app` ever since. Two consequences run through this document: the manifest at HEAD is the staleness authority rather than a stated count, and a component change is a Claude Code prompt followed by a commit rather than a canvas edit.

---

## Why this exists, and what it corrects from the IDEA version

The IDEA standard was written after a deck shipped using one design system component across 29 slides with a hand-rolled parallel motion vocabulary. Its fix is the load-bearing rule here too: **a prompt that does not name components per sheet gets hand-rolled sheets.**

This version corrects one architectural decision the IDEA standard inherited. IDEA ships four deck templates as starting points. A template is a copied file, so it forks on first use and receives no later fix. IDEA's four are already drifting from the components they were built on.

This system ships **one minimal shell, twenty-six sheet patterns as components, and six recipes as documentation.** A recipe is an ordered list of sheet patterns written in this file, not a file on disk. Nothing forks, hybrid composition is the default rather than an exception, and a fix to a sheet pattern reaches every deck that ever used it.

---

## The two paths

Roughly thirty decks a year run for weekly meetings. An eight-step scoping protocol is correct for a kickoff deck built once a season and completely wrong for a Tuesday meeting. A system with one speed gets used for kickoff and abandoned by October.

**Fast path.** A recipe is selected, filled, and built. No slide inventory, no scoping session, no chat approval round. Variety comes from the recipe's built-in rotation, not from design work. Applies to BRIEFING, TRAINING, and STRATEGY.

**Full path.** The complete scoping protocol below. Applies to REVIEW, KICKOFF, and OUTREACH, and to anything external, judged, or built once a season.

The variety budget goes to the full path. Spending it where a deck runs once a year, and buying the weekly deck out of a recipe, is how both "visually staggering" and "every week" survive together.

**Nothing prevents a fast-path deck from adding a full-path sheet.** A recipe is a starting list, not a ceiling. Dropping a `FieldSheet` into a briefing is a normal edit, not an exception.

---

## Session prerequisites

`FRC_Design_System.md` must be in context before scoping begins. Both governing documents are also committed to `src/lib/design-system/docs/` in `frc-app`, so a Claude Code session reads them from HEAD rather than depending on an attachment arriving. Project knowledge holds the copy Alejandro maintains; a version ships to both in the same pass. It carries the token layer, the FIRST usage rules, and the component manifest. Scoping without it means naming components from memory, which is how an inventory ends up specifying something that does not exist.

**Harness reproducibility.** The `/_ds` specimen route must boot from a clean checkout. Any environment file, launch configuration, or port setting it needs is committed as a tracked example, and no auth gate stands in front of it. A harness that runs on one machine is not a verification mechanism, it is a personal convenience, and the first time someone else needs to check a component they will skip the check instead.

**Staleness check, and it is a feature probe, not a count.** The Claude Design binding does not refresh on its own. It refreshes when someone runs `/design-sync` in Claude Code against the repo, and nothing in the Design interface says how old the bundle is: the uploaded bundle carries no commit sha anywhere, so it cannot be asked what it holds.

Counts do not answer the question either, and reaching for one wastes a turn. `_ds_manifest.json` registers documented components as cards, `ds:audit` counts the exported registry, and neither number moves when a token file changes or a component gains a prop, which is most of what lands in a normal week.

So the probe is behavioral. Before a full-path build, ask the Design session four yes-or-no questions about the newest features to land, newest first, and require four yes. Features ship in order, so if the most recent one is present everything before it is too. The first no tells you where the sync stopped.

A build must not start on a failed probe. A spec written against components the bundle does not have is unbuildable, and an unbuildable spec is how a deck ends up pulling repo source into the Design project and editing components from that side, which happened once and cost a rebuild. **Fork the system and every future repo fix reaches neither copy.**

**One session at a time against one project.** A design-sync run ends in an atomic upload. Two running concurrently means two uploads racing the same project and two branches independently fixing the same defects, which happened and cost a reconciliation pass. Confirm nothing is running before starting one, and if a run fails, report the failure rather than racing another.

## Scope and routing

| Artifact | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Meeting, training, strategy, review deck | Claude Design | Layout is the product |
| Kickoff, outreach, sponsor, judge deck | Claude Design | Same |
| One-pager, poster, pit signage for screen | Claude Design | Same |
| Printed handout for a bench or binder | Print pipeline per `IDEA_PRINT_STANDARDS.md` | Ink and paper rules differ entirely |
| Anything in `frc-app` or `idea-app` | Claude Code | Lives in a repo |
| The design system itself: any token, component, or sheet pattern | Claude Code | Lives in `frc-app` |
| Anything stateful or persisting data | Claude Code | Not a layout problem |

---

## Recipes

A recipe names ground, audience default, sheet patterns in order, and the rotation that keeps repeated runs from looking identical. Chat pastes the recipe into the prompt's per-sheet spec and edits from there.

### BRIEFING (fast path)
Weekly meeting. Ground SQUADRON, audience internal, 8 sheets.

`CoverSheet` · `AgendaSheet` · `SubteamStatusSheet` (one per active subteam) · `BlockerSheet` · `TargetsSheet` · `ScheduleSheet` · `SafetySheet` · `ClosingSheet`

Rotation: the cover cycles through four SQUADRON ambient layers by week number, and the agenda alternates between a numbered rail and a `JumpGrid` hub. Both are built into the recipe so the variety costs nothing per week.

### TRAINING (fast path)
Skills and certification session. Ground SQUADRON, audience internal, 10 to 14 sheets.

`CoverSheet` · `AgendaSheet` · `SafetySheet` · `SectionSheet` · `ProcedureSheet` (repeats) · `SplitSheet` (repeats) · `PartCallout` sheets as needed · `ComparisonSheet` · `ClosingSheet`

The safety sheet is second, not buried. Any training touching shop equipment carries it before the first procedure.

### STRATEGY (fast path)
Match strategy and scouting review. Ground FIELD, audience internal, 8 to 12 sheets.

`CoverSheet` · `SeasonSheet` · `FieldSheet` · `MatchBreakdownSheet` · `ScoutingSheet` · `DataSheet` · `ComparisonSheet` · `TargetsSheet` · `ClosingSheet`

The only recipe where `AllianceSplit` and the alliance colors are legal.

### REVIEW (full path)
Design review and technical review. Ground FIELD, audience internal, 9 to 12 sheets.

`CoverSheet` · `AgendaSheet` · `SectionSheet` · `CalloutDrawing` sheets · `DataSheet` · `ComparisonSheet` · `ScheduleSheet` · `BlockerSheet` · `StatementSheet` · `ClosingSheet`

Drawing-office plain. Tighter chrome, glow only on hero numerals, `HudFrame` on data sheets only.

### KICKOFF (full path, variety budget)
Season kickoff and game analysis. Ground FIELD with SQUADRON bookends, audience external, 14 to 18 sheets.

`CoverSheet` (external) · `SeasonSheet` · `SectionSheet` · `FieldSheet` · `MatchBreakdownSheet` · `GallerySheet` · `ComparisonSheet` · `DataSheet` · `ScheduleSheet` · `RosterSheet` · `TargetsSheet` · `StatementSheet` · `SponsorSheet` · `ClosingSheet` (external)

The deck that most justifies a hybrid ground: SQUADRON identity bookends around a FIELD content body.

### OUTREACH (full path, variety budget)
Sponsor, judge, parent night, recruitment, awards. Ground SQUADRON, audience external, 12 to 16 sheets.

`CoverSheet` (external) · `StatementSheet` · `SectionSheet` · `TimelineSheet` · `GallerySheet` · `RosterSheet` · `DataSheet` · `AwardSheet` · `QuoteSheet` · `SponsorSheet` · `ClosingSheet` (external)

Every FIRST usage rule is mandatory here rather than advisory. This is the deck a judge reads.

---

## The scoping protocol (full path)

No prompt is written until every step is answered. Where a reasonable default exists, chat proposes it with a one-line rationale rather than asking. Genuine forks are asked as tappable multiple choice, one question per fork, three questions maximum per turn.

### Step 1. Purpose and room
What the artifact does in one sentence. Where it runs: projected in the shop bay, handed off as PDF, shown on a laptop to a judge. Who operates it. **If anyone other than Alejandro may run it, the mentor constraint applies:** nothing may depend on undocumented knowledge of how the artifact behaves. Whether it must survive printing or export, which decides whether hidden-by-default content is legal at all. It usually is not.

### Step 2. Content spine
Parts named, with sheet ranges. Whether the deck can be entered mid-stream; if yes, a hub and persistent orientation chrome are required. Whether pacing is predictable; if not, every part boundary is a legal stopping point. Which sheets carry speaker notes, in `data-speaker-notes` on the section. Which blocks of copy are expected to change after the build, since everything on that list needs a canvas-editable home.

### Step 3. Sheet inventory
**The step that prevents hand-rolled sheets.** Every sheet gets a row before anything is built.

| # | Purpose | Sheet pattern | Components inside | Transition | Entrances | Image slots | Build states | Interrogable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

A sheet with nothing in column three is a sheet that will be hand-built.

The Interrogable column marks sheets carrying click targets. It matters operationally: a clicker cannot drive them, so those are the sheets you walk to the screen for.

Chat proposes the full table. Alejandro edits it. The approved table goes into the prompt verbatim.

### Step 4. Ground and audience plan
Ground per part, not only per deck. Audience per section where it differs from the root. Which parts use `.frc-ground-paper`, since value contrast breaks monotony harder than any other move and is chronically under-used.

### Step 5. Motion plan
One transition per non-build sheet from the four that exist. Entrance budget per sheet, default maximum six. Ambient texture maximum one per sheet and not on every sheet. Stagger via `frc-d1` through `frc-d8` only.

### Step 5b. Fill and copy budget
**The step that prevents a correct deck from looking empty.** The sheet patterns lay content out in normal flow and do not distribute it vertically, so a spec that names a pattern and some copy will produce a sheet with content in the top half and ground below it. Nothing else in this protocol catches that, because every other step is satisfied.

Two numbers are set before the prompt is written and both go into it.

**Fill floor, and it is kind-aware, not uniform.** `tokens/sheets.css` assigns every sheet kind a distribution axis of start, center or stretch. The floor applies to the stretch and center kinds, where the pattern is built to grow into its row. It does not apply to the start kinds, where a short authored list at 41 to 58% is the correct look and stretching it would be the pattern lying about how much it holds.

A start-kind sheet that reads empty is a content problem, not a distribution problem, and it is fixed with an image, a merge, or fewer sheets. Never by stretching, never by prose, never by enlarging an ambient layer.

Read the current axis assignment from `tokens/sheets.css` before setting a target. Do not assume it; it is chosen per kind and it changes.

For the kinds the floor does apply to: content occupies at least 85% of frame height above the footer rail. Reached by scaling content up and distributing it, or by an image the image plan names. Never by adding prose and never by enlarging an ambient layer, which sits behind content and is never the content. A sheet that cannot reach the floor within the copy budget is reported, not shipped and not padded.

**Copy budget.** 60 words of body per sheet excluding title, eyebrow, table cells and footnotes. 20 words per sentence. One line per card in a grid of four or more. Overflow goes to `data-speaker-notes` as topic bullets. It does not go on the wall.

Both are stated as an acceptance test in the prompt: the build reports its measured fill percentage for every sheet.

### Step 6. Reveal and interaction plan
Pacing: which sheets need stepped delivery and how many build states each gets. Interrogation: which sheets carry click targets, what each emphasizes, what the base state shows.

**Sequential reveal is not a decorative build and is not counted against the build budget.** Stepping through an authored list one item at a time, so a gallery of nine cards or a table of five rows arrives in sequence rather than all at once, is a pacing decision about the room. The four-chain budget exists to stop decorative animation from accumulating and was written before this case existed. A deck may put per-item reveal on every multi-item sheet it has.

The distinction is authorship: if the items are content the spec lists, reveal is free. If the states exist to make something appear interesting, the budget applies.

Reveal uses the system's own mechanism. If the patterns do not support per-item stepping, the build stops and reports it, and it is fixed in the repo through Loop A. A hand-rolled click handler in a deck is a defect.

### Step 7. Image plan
Every slot listed with id, subject, source, treatment, frame variant, and placeholder text. Sheets carrying **no** visual aid are listed here too, each with a one-line reason. Slot ids follow `s{sheet}-{subject}`. Placeholder text is photography direction, not a label.

### Step 8. Confirm and lock
Chat restates every decision compactly. Alejandro confirms. Only then is the prompt written.

---

## Prompt delivery

**Every Design prompt is delivered as a single pasteable block in the chat response, carrying a `MODEL | EFFORT` routing header.** Identical treatment to a Claude Code prompt. Not as a file to open, not as a link, not as prose to assemble. The rule that large content is written by Claude Code or a container script governs *file deliverables*; a prompt is not one, and a prompt that has to be opened before it can be pasted has added a step for no reason.

**The header sits outside the block, never inside it.** It is an instruction to Alejandro about which tool and which settings to select, not text for the tool to read. Inside the block it is noise the model has to skip past, and it invites the reader to edit the block before pasting, which defeats the point of one-click copy. The block contains the prompt and nothing else.

**The header names its destination first.** `CODE | MODEL | EFFORT` or `DESIGN | MODEL | EFFORT`, then the one-line reason. Adding the model header to Design prompts in v2.0 made the two kinds of block look identical, and a Design addendum was pasted into a Claude Code session within a day of that change: CC read a ten-sheet deck brief it had no context for, correctly refused, and a turn was lost. The destination is not inferable from the body, because a deck spec and a component change both talk about the same sheets and components.

The routing header states the model and effort for the session named, and the reason. High effort is the default for a full-path deck: reading two governing documents at HEAD, holding a ten-sheet spec, and recognising that a required capability is absent and reporting it rather than working around it are all judgment, not transcription. A fast-path recipe fill is medium.

## The prompt skeleton

Six sections in this order. One, two, and six are near-verbatim boilerplate.

**Boilerplate is referenced, not reprinted, once the governing documents are committed to the repo.** `FRC_Design_System.md` and this file live in `frc-app` at `docs/`, and Claude Design sources that repo, so section 2 is a pointer to both at HEAD plus the specific rules that have actually been violated in recent builds. Forty lines of reprinted inheritance in every prompt is how a prompt becomes unreadable, and an unreadable prompt gets skimmed.

Sections 3 and 4 collapse into one table plus a copy block. Pattern, ground, transition, ambient, reveal count and image slot are columns; the per-sheet section then carries only words. Stating the same fact in a table, a per-sheet paragraph, an image plan and a prohibition list is four places to update and three places to disagree.

### 1. Routing header

```
Use the FRC Team 5669 Design System. Start from a blank deck; this system has
no template, by design.

Set on the deck root, explicitly. None of these are inherited from anywhere:
  Aspect: 4:3, 1920 x 1440. The platform default is 16:9 and is wrong here.
  Ground class: .frc-ground-squadron
  Audience class: .frc-audience-internal
  .frc-letterbox, which declares the deck owns the viewport
  Mount DeckStage once, so canvas and letterbox paint from the active ground.

Output: a single .dc.html deck.
```

The routing header is the only thing carrying aspect, ground, and audience. A repo authored design system cannot contribute a template, so a deck that does not state these does not get them, and the failure is quiet: a 16:9 deck with no audience class renders correctly and is simply the wrong artifact.

### 2. Inheritance block

Pasted verbatim. Never paraphrased.

```
INHERITANCE, NON-NEGOTIABLE

Use the design system's own components and motion library. Do not
reimplement anything the system already ships.

Sheets: every sheet uses a pattern from the sheets/ group. Read the
matching sheets/<Name>.prompt.md before using one. A sheet built out of
raw markup instead of a pattern is a defect. If a named pattern does not
fit, stop and say so rather than substituting a hand-built equivalent.

Components: use the components named per sheet below. Read the matching
components/<group>/<Name>.prompt.md before using one.

Motion: use only classes defined in the FRC motion tokens.
  Slide transitions: frc-slide-shutter | frc-slide-boot |
    frc-slide-banner | frc-slide-cut
  Element entrances: frc-in-rise | drop | left | right | fade | blur |
    tracking | stamp | zoom | strike | flicker
  Image reveals: frc-img-wipe | wipe-down | iris | chamfer | zoom | kenburns
  Ambient texture layers, static, stacked as
    <div class="frc-ambient frc-ambient-NAME">:
    SQUADRON: patch | stencil | chevron | stars | rivet | bloom
    FIELD: extrusion | tread | hazard | matrix | fieldgrid | bracket | bloom
    PAPER: grid | hatch | foldline
  Ambient loops, animation: frc-bg-pan | scanlines | pulse | drift | shimmer
  Stagger: frc-d1 through frc-d8

The two ambient systems are separate and not interchangeable. The static
layers are what a sheet's atmosphere is built from; the loops animate a
layer that is already there.

Do not define custom animation classes. Do not define custom keyframes.
Do not create a parallel motion vocabulary under any prefix.

Colors: tokens only. Never invent a color, never hardcode a hex that is
not already a token value.

Gold is never body copy. Gold is illegal on the paper ground; that scope
carries bronze ink instead.

Alliance red and alliance blue appear only inside AllianceSplit,
ScoutTable, MatchBreakdownSheet, and FieldDiagram, and only on the FIELD
ground. They are never decoration. LIVE and REC are a gold dot.

FIRST marks are used as supplied. Never recolored, rotated, skewed,
cropped, bordered, or combined with added text. Never on a busy
background: ambient layers are clipped out of the footer logo zone.
FIRST in text is always all caps and italic with a superscript registered
symbol on first use. Use the FirstName component; do not type it by hand.

Images: every image slot carries exactly one of the three treatments named
per slot below, ImageFrame, ImageFrame with bleed, or Cutout. Never
hand-roll a filter, tint, gradient, mask, or scanline composite over an
image slot. Sponsor logos are Cutout with ground="none". QR codes are the
one exemption and are named as such in the slot plan.

Copy: running copy goes in element children or a component's child slot.
Do not move copy into a component prop or into the data-props script block
unless that block is listed as locked copy in Declared Exceptions.
```

### 3. Global chrome spec
Footer content, sheet numbering, hub behavior, progress rail, speaker notes policy, which sections override the deck ground or audience.

### 4. Per-sheet spec
The approved Step 3 table, one row per sheet, plus body copy per sheet.

### 5. Declared exceptions
Every deviation from the inheritance block, named in advance with a one-line reason:

```
EXCEPTION: Sheet 11 sponsor tier rule.
No sheet pattern covers a four-tier sponsor grid with per-tier sizing.
Hand-built on SponsorWall, hairline rule between tiers, 4px radius.
```

Undeclared hand-rolling is a defect and goes back for rebuild.

### 6. Prohibitions

```
Do not add sheets not in the spec.
Do not add motion not in the spec.
Do not substitute a hand-built element for a named sheet pattern or component.
Do not change the aspect ratio.
Do not use alliance red or blue outside the four named components.
Do not use a red for status. Warning is copper, error is rust, LIVE is gold.
Do not recolor, rotate, crop, or add anything to a FIRST mark.
Do not set font-size, padding, margin, gap, width or grid-template on a
  component or on a slot inside one.
Do not copy design system source into the Design project, generate a local
  bundle of it, or modify a component from the Design side.
Do not leave a sheet below the fill floor. Report it instead.
Do not pad a sheet with prose to reach the fill floor.
Do not hotlink an image the deck depends on. Embed it.
```

---

## Inheritance rules

**Strong default with declared exceptions.** Hand-building something the system already ships is a defect when it was not declared in advance and acceptable when it was.

The failure mode this addresses is not "the pattern did not fit." It is "the pattern was never considered." Requiring the exception in the prompt forces that consideration to happen at scoping time.

Chrome discipline:

- `HudFrame` on data and telemetry sheets only, never as general decoration.
- Glow on hero type and hero numerals only. Never body copy, never every heading, never on paper.
- Stats sit under a hairline rule, not inside bevelled boxes.
- One ambient texture per sheet maximum.
- Radii stay small: 2px chips and badges, 3px buttons and inputs, 4px cards and panels.
- Deck chrome never shows a neutral white.

## Pre-delivery audit

Run against every output before it is called finished. **The audit is a separate chat pass against the exported bundle.**

**This is not `ds:audit`.** Two things in this system are called an audit and both carry numbered checks. `ds:audit` is a script in `frc-app` that checks the design system **source**: token completeness, alias literals per scope, import order, manifest accuracy, asset hashes. The numbered checks below are a **manual pass against a generated deck**. The two number independently and must never be cross-referenced by number. When referring to either, name it: "pre-delivery check 43" or "`ds:audit` check 14."

**`ds:audit` green is a precondition for running the pre-delivery pass.** Twelve of the checks below now have source-side counterparts that run every commit, so auditing a generated artifact while the source is failing spends a chat pass finding what a script already reported.

**Editing the inheritance block in section 2 of the prompt skeleton requires repinning `ds:audit`.** What that check actually pins is narrower than the block: the motion vocabulary slice, from `Motion: use only classes defined in the FRC motion tokens.` through to `The two ambient systems are separate`. It hashes that slice and requires every class it names to have a rule in the token layer, one direction, so the doc and the tokens cannot drift apart silently. Edits to the Sheets, Components, Colors, Gold, Alliance, FIRST, Images, or Copy paragraphs cannot trip it.

The instruction stays wider than the mechanism on purpose. Repinning on any edit to the block is never wrong and occasionally unnecessary, which is the right direction for a rule whose failure surfaces as a code problem rather than a doc edit.

The split follows from what each can see. A deck's aspect ratio, sheet count, and visual quality exist only in the artifact. A token sheet's alias completeness exists only in the repo. Neither audit can do the other's job, and a check that could live in `ds:audit` should, because a script runs every commit and a chat pass runs when someone remembers. The session that built the artifact does not audit it, because the same reading that produced the mistake produces the check.

**Structure**
1. Every sheet uses a `sheets/` pattern. Zero sheets built from raw markup.
2. `frc-slide-*` occurrences equal the number of non-build sheets.
3. Aspect ratio matches the routing header.
4. Sheet count matches the spec. No sheets added.
5. Footer numbers logical sheets, not physical ones.
6. Build sheets carry no transition class and no stale entrance classes on carried-over elements.
7. Component usage matches the Step 3 table; every deviation appears in Declared Exceptions.

**Motion**
8. `frc-in-*` present, within the per-sheet entrance budget.
9. `frc-img-*` present on every image slot the plan called for.
10. `frc-d1` through `frc-d8` present wherever the plan called for stagger.
11. Ambient layer count does not exceed one per sheet, and ambient is not on every sheet.
12. Zero custom animation classes. Zero custom keyframes. Grep for any repeated non-`frc-` class prefix.

**Color**
13. Every `var(--token)` resolves. No hardcoded hex outside token values.
14. Gold appears on no body copy anywhere.
15. Gold appears nowhere inside a `.frc-ground-paper` scope.
16. Alliance red and blue appear only inside the four named components, only on FIELD.
17. No red is used for status. LIVE and REC render gold.
18. Ground class matches the plan per part; every scope declares its complete alias set as literals.

**FIRST compliance**
19. No FIRST mark is recolored, rotated, skewed, cropped, bordered, or carries added text.
20. No FIRST wordmark or icon element stands alone without a complete logo nearby.
21. Every occurrence of the FIRST name is all caps and italic, with a superscript registered symbol on first use in both heading and body, and is never plural or possessive.
22. Team number 5669 appears on every sheet carrying a FIRST mark.
23. No ambient layer runs behind the footer logo zone.
24. On an external deck: `ProgramLockup` on the cover, FIRST logo zone in the footer rail, sponsor rail on the closing sheet.

**Images**
25. Every image slot carries its planned treatment. `ImageFrame` plus `Cutout` wrappers plus declared QR exemptions equals slot count.
26. No alpha-carrying image sits inside `ImageFrame`. Every cutout uses `fit="contain"` and carries no hand-rolled filter chain.
27. No `bleed` on a screenshot slot.
28. Sponsor logos use `Cutout` with `ground="none"`.
29. QR slots render bare at full contrast and appear in the plan as exemptions.
30. Visual aid density meets the two-thirds floor; every text-only sheet appears in the Step 7 plan with its reason.
31. Rendered against every ground the deck actually uses. A slot verified only on SQUADRON is not verified.

**Interaction**
32. No element is hidden in its base state. Click targets change emphasis only.
33. Every interrogable sheet appears in the Step 3 inventory's Interrogable column.
34. Click targets are visibly affordant at projection scale.
35. Sheet state resets on re-entry.

**Copy**
36. No running copy sits in a component prop or `data-props` unless declared as locked copy.

**Output**
37. Print or PDF export shows all content, including every build state.
38. Text fits at 4:3 without overflow or forced shrinking.

**Deck root**
43. The deck root carries the aspect from the routing header, a ground class, an audience class, and `.frc-letterbox`, and `DeckStage` is mounted. All five come from the prompt and none are inherited, so all five are checked as present rather than as matching a plan. A generated deck defaults to 16:9 with no audience class, which renders perfectly well and is the wrong artifact.

`.frc-letterbox` is the one `DeckStage` cannot guard on, because its absence is legal: it declares that the deck owns the viewport, and an embedded deck correctly lacks it so it does not repaint its host page. A full-viewport deck missing it gets no canvas painting and flashes white on transition, which is the failure the stage exists to prevent, so the audit is the only thing standing between that and a shipped deck.

**Guards and visual verification**
40. Zero invariant guard fault markers anywhere in the deck. A marker is a caught defect, not an accepted state.
41. **Someone looked at it. This is a gate, not an aspiration.** Every sheet was viewed as a rendered image, on every ground the deck uses. DOM measurement is not visual verification: it confirms that an alias resolved, never that a sheet reads well, that two elements are not colliding, or that a layout is worth projecting. An audit run entirely on computed styles states so explicitly and is **incomplete**, and incomplete does not ship.

The evidence for promoting this is not an argument, it is a count. Seven distinct failures were caught by looking and missed by every measurement in place at the time: 26 sheet cards that were `display: none` while the stage around them measured exactly the declared viewport and reported it as proof they painted, for two weeks; a card captured mid-wipe that answered every DOM question correctly; `BlockerSheet` rendering bare status chips because its titles and owners were filed into buckets the row never rendered; six `SubteamStatus` notes silently dropped the same way; a dropped-copy detector reporting false positives because it compared against `innerText` while CSS uppercased the source; a probe whose own label rule was hitting the component under test; and a geometry diff keyed on text plus ordinal, so un-nesting shifted the ordinals and innocent elements looked moved.

The pattern in all seven is the same and it is worth stating plainly: **the measurement was working. It was measuring the wrong thing.** A `display: none` element answers every question about itself correctly. That is why a second, different kind of evidence is required rather than a more careful version of the first.

Automated capture settles first: finite animations are run to completion and infinite ambient loops parked at frame 0 before the frame is taken. A capture that fires on load photographs sheets mid-transition, and a wipe still crossing the frame looks enough like a design decision to be reviewed and approved.
42. Reduced motion checked by actually setting the preference, not only by measuring gate coverage and base state. Gate coverage proves the rule was applied; it does not prove the result is legible.

**Facts**
39. Every date, match number, team number, part number, dollar figure, sponsor name, award name, and proper name is checked against a source before delivery. Any projected figure is labeled projected on the sheet itself, not only in the notes.

**Fill, styling, and provenance**
44. Every sheet meets the fill floor **for its kind's axis**. Stretch and center kinds are held to the floor; start kinds are not, and holding them to it forces the two things the standard forbids. The build reports a measured percentage per sheet and the audit reads that report rather than eyeballing it. A sheet below the floor that was reported and accepted is a decision; one that was neither is a defect.
45. No component or slot inside one carries an inline `font-size`, `padding`, `margin`, `gap`, `width` or `grid-template`. Layout helpers on plain wrapper divs are legal only where declared. A deck restyling a component is the deck compensating for a component that does not do what the sheet needs, which is a Loop A trigger, not a deck fix.
46. The deck sources from the bound design system bundle. No copy of the repo source, no locally generated bundle, no modified component. If the bundle is stale, it is re-synced from GitHub; a fork of the system into a deck project means every future repo fix reaches neither copy.
47. Nothing the deck depends on is fetched at display time. QR codes, images and fonts that matter are embedded. A filtered or offline classroom network is the normal case, not the edge case. This is not only a delivery concern: a remote font `@import` in the token layer made every headless render wait 12.4 seconds for a request that was never going to succeed, so a full pass cost seventeen minutes, and every capture in the repo's history showed the fallback stack rather than the real faces. The fallback measured 16% wider than the shipped face, which means every line-break decision in the system had been made against type it does not use.
48. **A fix written to answer an audit finding is measured like any other change.** It inherits none of the verification that produced the check. One such patch, added after a geometry diff had already run, moved fifty-two boxes on a sheet nobody re-measured. The check found a real gap; the fix for it went unchecked because it arrived after the evidence.

## Live evolution

### Loop A: pattern and component promotion

**Trigger.** Every declared exception in a shipped prompt is logged as a promotion candidate. An exception is a written admission the system lacked something.

**Criterion.** Promote on the second use, or on the first if the element is obviously generic. One-off elements genuinely specific to a single deck stay hand-built. Promoting them inflates the library, which makes it harder to search, which causes hand-building. The failure mode is symmetric with under-promotion.

**Process.** Chat writes the promotion spec, then delivers it as a Claude Code prompt with a `MODEL | EFFORT` routing header. CC authors the `.jsx`, `.d.ts`, and `.prompt.md` in `src/lib/design-system/components/<group>/`, updates the group demo card, `_ds_manifest.json`, and the specimen route, then commits and pushes directly to main. Claude Design re-syncs from GitHub. The retired exception is then removed from the prompt template and from any deck spec that carried it. That last step is what closes the loop: a promoted pattern that prompts keep declaring an exception against was not actually promoted.

**A component is never edited on the Claude Design canvas.** The canvas edits deck copy. The repo owns the components. An edit made on the canvas to something that lives in `frc-app` is lost on the next re-sync, and worse, it is lost silently.

**Sheet patterns promote before components do.** If two decks hand-build the same sheet arrangement, the answer is a new sheet pattern, not three new components.

### Loop B: standards correction

**Trigger.** Any output that misses.

| Case | Fix |
|---|---|
| Rule was missing | Add it |
| Rule was ambiguous | Sharpen it, keep it in one place |
| Rule was wrong | Correct it, note the reversal in the changelog |
| Rule existed and was not followed | **Change nothing in the doc.** Add a check to the audit |

The fourth row carries the weight. Restating an existing rule louder does not make it more likely to be followed, and doing it repeatedly turns a standard into something too long to read, which produces exactly the failure it was written to prevent. A compliance failure is an audit gap, not a documentation gap.

**Timing.** The correction ships in the same turn as the miss, as a complete updated file. Never a patch list.

**Scope.** The correction lands in the one document that owns the rule. Brand, tokens, and components belong in `FRC_Design_System.md`. Scoping and prompting belong here. Duplicating a rule across documents guarantees they drift.

## Artifact types beyond decks

| Artifact | Starting point | Motion activation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deck | `templates/Deck.dc.html` | `[data-deck-active]` | Full transition set |
| One-pager, poster, pit signage | Static HTML | `.frc-run` container | No slide transitions. Entrances and ambient only |
| Printed handout | Print pipeline | none | Paper ground, print rules |

For any non-deck artifact, motion runs inside a `.frc-run` container and the four slide transitions do not apply. Element entrances, image reveals, ambient loops, and stagger work identically.

## Changelog

- **2.4 (2026-08-25)** - Four corrections from a week that took the design system from
  16 documented components to 79 and produced eleven defects nobody knew existed. **The
  staleness check is a feature probe, not a count**: the binding refreshes only when someone
  runs `/design-sync`, the uploaded bundle carries no commit sha, and the two available counts
  measure different things and neither moves when a prop changes. A build must not start on a
  failed probe, because a spec written against a bundle that lacks its components is
  unbuildable, and that is how a deck came to fork the system into its own project.
  **One session at a time against one project**, after two ran concurrently and both pushed
  fixes for the same defects. **Check 41 is a gate**: seven failures were caught by looking and
  missed by measurement, including 26 sheet cards that were `display: none` for two weeks while
  the stage around them reported the exact declared viewport. **Check 48**: a fix answering an
  audit finding gets measured like any other change; one such patch moved fifty-two boxes
  because it arrived after the geometry diff that would have caught it. Check 47 gains the font
  case, where a remote `@import` cost twelve seconds a card and meant every capture ever taken
  showed the wrong letterforms.
- **2.3 (2026-08-24)** - The fill floor is kind-aware. 2.0 set 85% on every sheet; landing the
  distribution axis in `tokens/sheets.css` showed that the start kinds correctly sit at 41 to
  58% and that a uniform floor would have the build fight a deliberate decision, winnable only
  by padding with prose or enlarging ambient, both of which this document forbids. A start-kind
  sheet that reads empty is a content problem and is fixed with an image, a merge, or fewer
  sheets.
- **2.2 (2026-08-24)** - The routing header sits outside the pasteable block. It addresses
  Alejandro, not the tool, and putting it inside meant the block could not be pasted without
  first being edited.
- **2.1 (2026-08-24)** - The routing header names its destination first, `DESIGN |` or
  `CODE |`. Giving Design prompts a `MODEL | EFFORT` header in 2.0 made both kinds of block
  indistinguishable on sight, and a deck addendum went to a Claude Code session the same day.
  The fix costs one word and the failure costs a turn.
- **2.0 (2026-08-24)** - Five corrections, all of them from the Meeting 01 deck, which took
  four builds. **Delivery:** every Design prompt now ships as a pasteable block in chat with a
  `MODEL | EFFORT` routing header, matching Claude Code. It had been going out as a file with
  no routing, on a misreading of the large-file rule, and a promise to change that made in a
  chat does not survive the chat. **Step 5b:** the fill floor and copy budget, because three
  consecutive builds satisfied every step of the protocol and still rendered content in the
  top half of the frame; nothing here caught it since nothing here asked. **Step 6:**
  sequential reveal of an authored list is exempt from the build budget, which was written
  before that case existed and was blocking a legitimate pacing decision. **Skeleton:**
  boilerplate is referenced rather than reprinted now that both governing docs are committed
  at `docs/`, and sections 3 and 4 collapse to a table plus a copy block, because the old
  shape stated each fact in four places. **Checks 44 to 47:** fill measured and reported,
  no inline restyling of components, no forking the system into a deck project, nothing the
  deck depends on fetched at display time. Check 46 exists because a build did fork the
  system and edited three components; check 47 because a build hotlinked the QR codes that
  were the entire point of the meeting.
- **1.9 (2026-08-23)** - Corrected the v1.8 description of what `ds:audit`'s inheritance pin
  covers. It hashes the motion vocabulary slice, not the whole inheritance block, so the
  Sheets, Components, Colors, Gold, Alliance, FIRST, Images and Copy paragraphs cannot trip
  it. The instruction to repin on any edit to the block stays wider than the mechanism, since
  it is never wrong and occasionally unnecessary.
- **1.8 (2026-08-23)** - Recorded two consequences of mechanizing twelve of the checks below
  into `ds:audit`. A green `ds:audit` is now a precondition for the pre-delivery pass, since
  auditing an artifact while the source is failing spends a chat pass on what a script
  already reported. And editing the inheritance block in the prompt skeleton requires
  repinning, because `ds:audit` hashes that block and compares the motion vocabulary it
  quotes against the token sheets; the coupling is what stops the two drifting, but it
  surfaces as a code failure rather than a doc edit, so the repin ships in the same pass.
- **1.7 (2026-08-23)** - Distinguished the pre-delivery audit from `ds:audit`. Both are called
  audits and both carry numbered checks, and a Claude Code prompt from this session
  cross-referenced them by number, sending a session looking for a check 43 in a script whose
  own checks stop at 15. They number independently and are now named explicitly when
  referenced. The split follows from what each can see: `ds:audit` checks the design system
  source in the repo, the numbered checks below check a generated deck, and anything that
  could live in `ds:audit` should, because a script runs every commit and a chat pass runs
  when someone remembers.
- **1.6 (2026-08-23)** - Gave `.frc-letterbox` its own bullet in the routing header. It was
  named only in prose under the DeckStage bullet while check 43 counts it as a fifth
  independent item, so the header and the check disagreed on what a deck must carry.
- **1.5 (2026-08-23)** - Added `.frc-letterbox` to check 43. `DeckStage` scopes document
  canvas painting behind it so an embedded deck does not repaint its host page, which is
  correct and makes it a fourth required root class that nothing can guard: its absence is
  legal for an embedded deck, so a full-viewport deck missing it silently gets no canvas
  painting and flashes white. Also recorded that both governing documents are committed to
  `src/lib/design-system/docs/`, after a Claude Code session built `DeckStage` without them
  because an attachment did not arrive. A repo file at HEAD cannot fail to arrive, which is
  the same argument that put the system in a repo to begin with.
- **1.4 (2026-08-23)** - Rewrote the routing header and added check 43. A repo authored
  design system cannot contribute a template, so "start from Deck.dc.html" named a mechanism
  that does not exist, and the header is now the only thing carrying aspect, ground, and
  audience. The verification deck came back 16:9 with zero audience class occurrences, which
  is the failure mode worth naming: it renders perfectly well and is simply the wrong
  artifact, so check 43 tests for presence rather than for matching a plan.
- **1.3 (2026-08-22)** - Amended check 41 to require automated capture to settle animations
  before shooting, running finite ones to completion and parking infinite ambient loops at
  frame 0. The first capture run photographed sheets mid-transition, and a wipe still
  crossing the frame looks enough like a design decision to be reviewed and approved, which
  would have made the visual audit worse than no audit.
- **1.2 (2026-08-22)** - Added audit checks 40 through 42 and a harness reproducibility
  prerequisite, all from gaps the three build passes exposed rather than from any rule being
  broken. Check 41 is the significant one: the build verified itself almost entirely by DOM
  measurement, which confirms an alias resolved but never that a sheet reads well, that two
  elements are not colliding, or that a layout is worth projecting, and a system whose whole
  brief is visual cannot be signed off on computed styles. Check 40 pairs with the new
  Invariant guards section in `FRC_Design_System.md`, which moves guards from throwing at run
  time to rendering a visible fault marker, so the audit is where a guard actually does its
  job. Check 42 closes the reduced-motion gap left open in pass 1.
- **1.1 (2026-08-22)** - Authoring moved from Claude Design to Claude Code, with the
  system living in `frc-app` at `src/lib/design-system/` and Claude Design sourcing it
  from GitHub. The reason is that Claude Design's output format is React either way, so
  authoring in React removes a translation step, and `frc-app` is React, which means the
  deck components and the app components can be one set. IDEA could not do this because
  `idea-app` is SvelteKit, so its 56 components were re-authored from a description and
  have drifted since. Three sections corrected to match: the staleness check now reads
  `_ds_manifest.json` at HEAD rather than a stated header count, which removes the digest
  regeneration and upload step entirely; Loop A promotion is now a CC prompt and a commit
  rather than a Claude Design task, with the added rule that a component is never edited
  on the canvas because that edit is lost silently on re-sync; and the routing table now
  sends design system changes themselves to Claude Code.
- **1.0 (2026-08-22)** - Initial standard. Establishes the sheet inventory as a required full-path scoping step, the verbatim inheritance block, the FIRST compliance checks as audit items rather than presenter memory, build sheets as the presenter-control mechanism, and 4:3 as the default. Departs from `IDEA_CLAUDE_DESIGN_STANDARDS.md` in two places. First, templates are replaced by one shell plus twenty-six sheet patterns as components plus six recipes as documentation, because a template is a copied file that forks on first use and receives no later fix; IDEA's four are already drifting from the components they were built on. Second, a two-path protocol, because a single eight-step protocol against a thirty-deck-a-year cadence gets abandoned, so the fast path buys weekly decks out of a recipe and the variety budget is spent on the six-a-year decks that justify it.
